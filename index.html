        Let's make this right. It's my pleasure to meet you. We are the Cloud Radio developers team and i'll be your guide through this documentation. First of all i highly recommend that you check our models. A model is also what you know as a table, or simply the format we save our data. It's important to note about our models that if a field has no information it won't be available when you select that record. By doing this we save space in our hard-disks and time in our processors. When you see a field in a model with type: Schema.Types.ObjectId this means that field is an id from another model. You'll always send me as a String, and you have the option to receive it as an object containing all the data related to the specific id.
